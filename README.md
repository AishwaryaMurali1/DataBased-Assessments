I have used Visual Studio Code to write and run the Python files. 
There are 3 code files, 3 test files and one README.md.


You can simply download the code and run the files from any IDE you have or from the command line too. 


To run the python files, first cd into the project directory using the command line
$ cd project_directory
$ python3 filename.py
$ python3 -m unittest test_file_name.py
